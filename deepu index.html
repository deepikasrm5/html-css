       <h2>School life..</h2>

       <h3>Upto 9<sup>th</sup> std...</h3> 

       <p>In LKG, I studied in<strong>Shankara vidhyalaya matriculation school,Tambaram</strong>.After LKG, I studied in<strong>King's matriculation higher secondary school, Madipakkam</strong>.
       From UKG to 5<sup>th</sup>std, I had a boring school life...From 6<sup>th</sup> std to 8<sup>th</sup> std,<b><i>Rema miss</i></b> is my favourite teacher who teaches <i><ins>social studies.</ins></i>
       She not only teaches studies...but also she teach <i>how to dance, march past</i> and so on..
       I don't want to tell about 9<sup>th</sup> std. In fact ther's nothing to say about my school life in 9<sup>th</sup> std.</p>

       <h3>10<sup>th</sup> std to 12<sup>th</sup> std...</h3>

       <p>In 10<sup>th</sup>std, I had a best friend named <strong> SAI APARAJITHA.</strong> At the starting of the academic year, we don't talk to each other too much.After the separation of the 
       class, we started talking and became close to each other..In 2020, we started to prepare for board exams. But unfortunately, it was cancelled all because of <strong> COVID-19</strong> spreading
       all over the world.Without writing our exams, we got passed to next academic year..In 11<sup>th</sup>std, among 12 months, 3 months went in school and remaining months went in online class..I chose <strong><em> Science with computer science</em></strong> group.
       Sai took <strong><em>Commerce with business maths.</em></strong> Unfortunately, that year board exams were also cancelled due to that idiot corona..</p>

       <p>In 12<sup>th</sup>std, lots of good memories were created other than the previous academic years.We eagerly waited for board exams atleast this time...But luckily,the date of board practical and theoritical exams were announced..
       We were so happy..But at the same time we felt sad that our school life is going to end...We wrote exams well...next we were waiting for results..I thought I had scored between 80% and 90%...But <b><i> FINALLY, I SCORED 560/600!!!</i></b>
       Me and my parents felt more and more happy...</p>

       <h2> After 12<sup>th</sup> .....</h2>

       <h3> Before FRESHWORKS...</h3>

       <p>My aunt told me to apply freshworks before 12<sup>th</sup> results.After applied,she told about it, and shared a youtube video of it.Then I attended <b>FSAT</b> exams..
       Then I got selected for next round...The telephonic interview was unannounced...after they said that "u were selected",I was shocked..next,I went to personal interview...I was so tensed whether I will be selected or not.
       On,<b><i> AUGUST 3<sup>rd</sup>,I GOT SELECTED TO BE ONE OF A STUDENT IN FRESHWORKS!!!</i></b></p>

       <h3> After FRESHWORKS...</h3>

       <p>Online class started from 14<sup>th</sup> of September. I thik I am so lucky to have teachers like <strong><em>REVATHI MAM and SURYA SIR</em></strong>.I enjoyed each class everyday..
        I think I little bit developed my <ins>English, confidence level and my self learning.</ins></p>
